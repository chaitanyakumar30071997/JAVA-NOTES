try block: This is where you put the code that might misbehave. It’s like saying, “Hey, Java, keep an eye 
on this part.”


catch block: When an exception happens in the try block, the catch block swoops in to save the day.
 It catches the exception and deals with it. Think of it as your program’s superhero.
 
 
finally block: This block always executes, whether an exception occurred or not. It’s like the janitor who 
cleans up after the party, no matter how wild things got.



Checked exception :-  compile time exception

UnChecked :- Run time exception
