1. for Loop
   Definition: The for loop is used to execute a block of code a specific number of times. It is useful
    when you know beforehand how many times you need to repeat a task.
    
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed
}

2. for each Loop (Enhanced for Loop)

        Definition: The for each loop, also known as the enhanced for loop, is used to iterate over elements 
        in a collection or array. It is simpler and cleaner when you just need to traverse the entire 
         collection or array.    
         
         for (type element : collection) {
    // code to be executed
}

* Both loops are essential for iterating through data, with for loops offering more control over the 
   iteration process and for each loops providing a more concise way to iterate over collections and arrays.
