                                           CONTROL STATEMENTS
                                           
 Control statements in Java are used to control the flow of execution in a program. They enable the program to make decisions, execute different blocks of code conditionally, or iterate over code blocks multiple times. Hereâ€™s an overview of the main types of control statements in Java:

1. Decision-Making Statements
These statements allow the program to choose different paths of execution based on certain conditions.

if statement: Executes a block of code if the specified condition is true.

Example:

if (condition) { 

// code to be executed if condition is true 

}

if-else statement: Executes one block of code if the condition is true, and another block if the condition is false.



if (condition) {

 // code to be executed if condition is true

 }

 else {

 // code to be executed if condition is false 

}

if-else-if ladder: Allows for multiple conditions to be checked sequentially.

Example:

if (condition1) {

 // code to be executed if condition1 is true 

} 

else if (condition2) {

 // code to be executed if condition2 is true

 } 

else { 

// code to be executed if all conditions are false

 }

switch statement: Selects a block of code to execute from multiple options based on the value of an expression.

Example:

switch (expression) { 

case value1: // code to be executed if expression equals value1 break; 

case value2: // code to be executed if expression equals value2 break; 

// you can have any number of case statements 

default: // code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case

 }
