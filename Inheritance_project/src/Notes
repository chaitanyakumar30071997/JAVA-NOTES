INHERITANCE:

    * Extending or inheriting one class to another class is called inheritance. We can achieve 
      inheritance with help of extends or implements keywords.

    * We  can use extends keyword Class to Class ( or ) Interface to Interface.         

     * We  can use implements keyword Class to Interface.

Multi-level inheritance:

    * Assume we have 3 classes A,B,C . Class B extends A, Class C extends B.

    * Here class B is extending class A features directly.

     * Here class C is extending class B features directly. Here class C is extending class A 
      features indirectly.

 Multiple inheritance:

     * Extending or Inheriting multiple class features into another class is nothing but multiple 
     inheritance. Java does not support the multiple inheritance.

Explanation(Multiple inheritance):

     * Assume we have 3 classes A,B,C. A extends B,C.

     *  Here B & C has same method which is “add” while creating object for “A” and calling to 
        add method. JVM will confuse which method has to be used.
        
 Super keyword?
      Ans : in when create obj class have Facebook home as same line home_class jvm check 
      the first with in class so, When we use super keyworld   jvm check another page class
