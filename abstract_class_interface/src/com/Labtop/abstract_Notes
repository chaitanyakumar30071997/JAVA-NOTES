                                       Abstract

  -->	Abstraction is nothing but hiding the implementation . We can achieve the abstraction using
         the abstract class and interface.

INTERFACE:

    -->  Blueprint of the class is nothing but interface which you have only method declaration 
        and doesnâ€™t have the method implementation .We used to called them as abstract class.

***ABSTRACT METHOD:

    -->  The method which is having the abstract keyword and doesn't have the implementation is 
        called abstract method.

***Note1:

    -->  When we write abstract method in interface we no need to add the abstract keyword As 
       interface includes abstract keyword for all the methods.

***Note2:

   --> If a class implements the interface all the methods which is present inside the interface
       has to be implemented.


ABSTRACT CLASS:

   -->  The class which is having the abstract keyword is called  abstract class. It contains
        both abstract and non-abstract methods. Normal classes will not allow to write 
        abstract methods inside the class.

* Note:

   -->   If a class extends the abstract class it is mandatory to implement all abstract 
         methods in the implemented class
