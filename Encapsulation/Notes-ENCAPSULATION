                                      ENCAPSULATION
                                      
1. ENCAPSULATION:

      Holding the data into single entity is nothing but encapsulation.

2. How to achieve:

     we can achieve Data (or) Model (or) POJO class . The class which is having the data members and does 
     not have the declaration. POJO stands for Plain Old Java Object 

* We should have the setters and getters for the data members.

* this.id ---->” this”  is one of the reserved word in java. which helps to set the value to the data
    members (with in the class only).
