                            Method Overloading:-
Method overloading allows us to define multiple methods with the same name in a class, but with 
different parameter lists. There are two primary ways to achieve method overloading:

Different Numbers of Arguments:-
You can implement two or more methods with the same name but different numbers of arguments.

In this example, the multiply method is overloaded to handle different argument counts.




                                     Method Overriding
*  Method overriding occurs when a subclass (child class) provides a specific implementation for a method 
   that is already declared in its parent class (superclass). Here are the key points about method overriding:

*  The method in the subclass must have the same name, same parameter list, and an IS-A relationship with 
   the method in the parent class.
*  When you call an overridden method using an object of the subclass type, Java uses the methodâ€™s 
   implementation in the subclass rather than the one in the superclass.
*  Method overriding is essential for achieving runtime polymorphism.
